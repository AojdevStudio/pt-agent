### Core Features
	1.	Multi-Agent System Using OpenAI Agents SDK
	•	Functionality: Implements a modular architecture with specialized agents, such as a Research Agent and an Orchestrator Agent, to handle distinct tasks within the system.
	•	Importance: Enhances scalability and maintainability by separating concerns and allowing each agent to focus on specific responsibilities.
	•	Implementation: Utilizes the OpenAI Agents SDK to define and manage agents. For example, the Research Agent fetches and processes relevant fitness research, while the Orchestrator Agent uses this information to generate personalized workout plans.
	2.	Dynamic Workout Plan Generation
	•	Functionality: Generates personalized Push–Pull–Legs (PPL) split workout plans in four-week progressive cycles.
	•	Importance: Provides structured and progressive training regimens tailored to the user’s goals and current fitness level.
	•	Implementation: The Orchestrator Agent uses data from the Research Agent and the user’s biometric inputs to create and adjust workout plans dynamically.
	3.	Personalized Load and Intensity Calculation
	•	Functionality: Calculates optimal weights and intensity levels for each exercise based on the user’s performance history and readiness metrics.
	•	Importance: Ensures workouts are challenging yet safe, promoting continuous improvement while minimizing injury risk.
	•	Implementation: Combines estimated one-rep max (e1RM) calculations with readiness scores to adjust load prescriptions accordingly.
	4.	Biometric Readiness Integration
	•	Functionality: Integrates data from the Oura Ring to assess the user’s readiness and recovery status.
	•	Importance: Aligns training intensity with the user’s physiological state, optimizing performance and recovery.
	•	Implementation: A nightly cron job fetches data from the Oura API, which the Orchestrator Agent uses to adjust the next day’s workout plan.
	5.	Progress Tracking and Gamification
	•	Functionality: Tracks workout completion and awards points and badges to motivate the user.
	•	Importance: Enhances user engagement and adherence to the training program.
	•	Implementation: The system logs completed workouts and assigns points, culminating in weekly summaries that include earned badges. ￼
	6.	Curated Knowledge Base Integration
	•	Functionality: Maintains an embedded knowledge base of fitness research to inform workout planning.
	•	Importance: Ensures that training recommendations are grounded in scientific evidence.
	•	Implementation: Research documents are processed and stored in a vector database (e.g., Supabase with pgvector), which the Research Agent queries as needed.

User Experience

User Persona:
	•	Name: Chinyere (“Ossie”)
	•	Profile: A dedicated fitness enthusiast with a background in weightlifting, seeking a structured and scientifically informed training regimen.

Key User Flows:
	1.	Weekly Plan Delivery:
	•	Every Sunday, the system sends Ossie a detailed workout plan for the upcoming week, including readiness assessments and progress summaries.
	2.	Daily Workout Execution:
	•	Ossie uses a command-line interface (CLI) to view the day’s workout plan and logs completed exercises post-workout.
	3.	Research Update:
	•	Ossie can add new research papers to the system, which are then processed and integrated into the knowledge base for future workout planning.

UI/UX Considerations:
	•	The initial interface is CLI-based for simplicity and ease of use.
	•	Future iterations may include a progressive web application (PWA) for enhanced user interaction and visualization.
